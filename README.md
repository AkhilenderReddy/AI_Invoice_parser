# AI Invoice Parser API

This project provides an API endpoint to extract structured data from invoice documents (currently supporting PDF files). It leverages LangGraph and OpenAI (via OpenRouter) to intelligently parse and extract information such as order details, seller and buyer information, and individual invoice items.

## Features

- **PDF Invoice Processing:** Upload a PDF invoice and receive structured JSON output containing extracted data.
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction:** Extracts key information including:
    - Order and Invoice Numbers/Dates
    - Transaction and Invoice IDs
    - Total Invoice Value and Mode of Payment
    - Place of Supply and Delivery
    - Seller Details (Name, GST, PAN, Address, Bank Information, Contact Details)
    - Buyer Details (Name, GST, PAN, Address, Contact Details, Billing/Shipping Addresses)
    - Invoice Items (Serial Number, HSN, Description, Unit Price, Quantity, Net Amount, Taxes, Total Amount)
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages for invalid file types or processing issues.
- **Modular Design:** Utilizes LangGraph for a well-structured and maintainable extraction pipeline.
